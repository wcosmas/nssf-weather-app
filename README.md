# NSSF Weather App

This is a README file for a NSSF Weather App. The app is built using React Native and Expo, which allows for easy development and deployment across multiple platforms.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- Yarn package manager
- Expo CLI (install globally using `npm install -g expo-cli`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Povide Keys

Please provide the `googleApiKey` and the  `openWeatherMapApiKey` for the Places API and the open weather map API.

### Running the App

To run the app locally, use the following command: Incase you the weather data is not loaded, please refresh the app. Such issues are common while bundling the app

```
expo start
```

This will start the development server and open the Expo DevTools in your browser. You can then choose to run the app on a physical device/emulator or on the web.
